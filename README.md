# Laser Carriage for Makeblock XY

This is a carriage that you can use to mount a laser to
your
[Makeblock XY Plotter](http://www.makeblock.com/xy-plotter-robot-kit/)
kit.  Since this is a work in progress there might be some updates to
this, but for now, this appears to work pretty well.  I might want to
extend it so that I can have a height adjustable mount for the laster
(ie a Z-aksis).

# WARNING

**Please be careful with lasers.  They can be extremely nasty.  If you
hurt yourself or someone else using this design, it is your fault and
your fault alone.  Don't be an idiot.**
